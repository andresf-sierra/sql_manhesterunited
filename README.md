European Football Data Analysis with SQL: Manchester United Performance

Using SQL to answer soccer questions? Weird! Because I'm not a soccer fan. Whatever, soccer matches generate a lot of DATA, and of that, I'm a big fan.

Using basic SQL clauses such as CASE WHEN, LEFT JOIN, and aggregation functions like SUM, AVG, and COUNT, you can easily obtain and interpret data.

- How many home and away goals did Manchester United score in each season?
- How many home and away matches did Manchester United win in each season?
- What is Manchester United's average number of goals per season?
- What percentage of Manchester's games did they win in each season?
